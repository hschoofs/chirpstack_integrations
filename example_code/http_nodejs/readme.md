HTTP Integration


This node application receives data via HTTP requests from a chirpstack server. The data is then inserted into a local influx database.

The code is not very efficient and could be a lot shorter (I think its possible to get away with one influx instance for all measurements, also the if statements are not very clean).

The decoding part is an example from Adafruit (https://learn.adafruit.com/the-things-network-for-feather/payload-decoding) and not relevant for most applications.

The application also logs some server data to an Influxdb measurement everytime it gets an HTTP-request.
